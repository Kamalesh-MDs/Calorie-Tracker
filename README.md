# Calorie Tracker

This is a simple calorie-tracking web app I made using basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The purpose of this project is to calculate daily calories based on the common foods I usually eat. I also used this project to practice JavaScript logic, DOM manipulation, and storing data in the browser using localStorage.

## What the app does
- Select a food item
- Enter the quantity (grams or count)
- Automatically calculates the calories
- Shows total calories for the day
- Stores the data until the next day
- Works smoothly on mobile
- Hosted on GitHub Pages so I can access it easily from my phone

- Simple UI design
- Hosting a webpage using GitHub Pages
